- 👋 Hi, I’m Sara Kingsley. 
- 👀 I’m interested in building systems to assess the risks of AI for economies. 
- 🌱 Most of my work focuses on building transformer models for automated or human-augmented AI system evaluation, metrics for these evaluations, and data science tools for AI/ML. 
- 💞️ I'm currently looking to collaborate on building generative AI red-teaming tools.
- 📫 How to reach me: <skingsle@cs.cmu.edu>
